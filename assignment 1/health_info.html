                        <h2>Nutrition Tips</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Eat a Variety of Foods</b>: Include a mix of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins in your diet. This ensures you get a wide range of essential nutrients.</li>
                            <li><b>Stay Hydrated</b>: Drink at least 8 glasses of water a day. Proper hydration helps maintain energy levels, supports digestion, and improves overall well-being.</li>
                            <li><b>Limit Processed Foods</b>: Processed foods are often high in sugars, unhealthy fats, and sodium. Opt for whole, unprocessed foods whenever possible.</li>
                            <li><b>Control Portion Sizes</b>: Be mindful of your portion sizes to avoid overeating. Use smaller plates to help control your portions, and eat slowly to allow your body to signal when it's full.</li>
                            <li><b>Healthy Snacking</b>: Choose snacks like nuts, seeds, fruits, or yogurt instead of sugary treats. These options are packed with nutrients and keep you feeling full longer.</li>

                        <h2>Exercise Tips</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Aim for 30 Minutes Daily</b>: Engage in at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity each day. This can include walking, jogging, cycling, or dancing.</li>
                            <li><b>Incorporate Strength Training</b>: Include strength training exercises like push-ups, squats, or lifting weights at least two days a week. This helps build muscle and improve bone density.</li>
                            <li><b>Stay Active Throughout the Day</b>: Avoid sitting for long periods. Take short breaks to stretch, walk, or do some quick exercises to keep your blood flowing.</li>
                            <li><b>Find Activities You Enjoy</b>: Exercise doesn't have to be boring! Find activities you enjoy, such as swimming, playing sports, or practicing yoga, to make staying active fun and sustainable.</li>
                            <li><b>Warm Up and Cool Down</b>: Always start with a warm-up to prepare your body for exercise and end with a cool-down to reduce the risk of injury.</li>
